Overall Inference and Best Model Selection

Best Model:

The SARIMA model is the best-performing model based on error metrics. Its ability to incorporate seasonal trends and non-seasonal components is particularly valuable for this dataset, as indicated by the lowest MAE, RMSE, and MAPE values.

MAE: 11,445,292.846

RMSE: 13,532,224.062

MAPE: 0.097 (9.7%)

Analysis:

The SARIMA model outperforms all other models with the lowest MAE, RMSE, and MAPE values, indicating that it effectively captures both seasonal and non-seasonal patterns in the data. The model’s MAPE of 9.7% reflects high accuracy, making it the best-suited model for this dataset.

MAE: 10,390,978.253

RMSE: 16,121,538.82

MAPE: 0.087 (8.7%)

Analysis

The Prophet model achieves a MAPE of 8.7%, which is lower than most of the other models except for SARIMA. With a lower MAE and competitive RMSE, Prophet is highly effective for this time series dataset.

Comparison with SARIMA and Other Models

The SARIMA model still slightly outperforms Prophet in terms of RMSE and MAE, with a MAPE of 9.7%. However, the Prophet model’s MAPE of 8.7% reflects higher accuracy, suggesting Prophet might generalize better when trends and seasonality are more varied.

Considerations:

Prophet for a more flexible, robust model suited for complex seasonality and varied patterns.

SARIMA if seasonality is well-defined and consistency across series is desired.

ARMA performs well with 11.7% MAPE, making it a viable choice if a simpler model is needed without explicit seasonality.

AR(1) also shows reasonable performance and can be useful for short-term forecasting where simpler models are preferred.
